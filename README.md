# 🐍 Snake Game in C

A classic console-based Snake Game developed using C programming to understand
game logic, movement algorithms, and collision detection.

## 🎯 Project Objective
- Design a playable Snake game
- Implement real-time movement using keyboard input
- Handle collision detection and score updates

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used
- Loops and conditionals
- Arrays / structures
- Coordinate-based movement
- Collision detection logic
- Real-time input handling

## 🛠 Technologies
- Language: C
- Platform: Console application

## 🎮 Game Rules
- Snake grows when it eats food
- Game ends if snake hits the wall or itself
- Score updates dynamically

## 🚀 Learning Outcome
This project strengthened my logical thinking, problem-solving skills,
and understanding of real-time application flow in C.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Difficulty levels
- Obstacles
- Sound effects
